# Job Market Analysis Based on Handshake
## Project Goal:
This project aims to help students major in Applied Data Science and Business Analytics to better understand what skills they should develop throughout their academic careers, what experiences they should highlight on their resumes, and which areas will offer them better chances to land a job. 
## Handshake Dataset 
The handshake dataset consolidates Handshake job data from five excel files. The five Handshake job excel files were originally created by the Career Center at Whitman School of Management and sent out to all Whitman students via email. Upon the completion of data consolidation, I have a Handshake dataset ( Handshake_Internship_Job.xlsx) that contains job information on various types of jobs including Business Analysis and Data Scientists. The dataset with a total of 11 columns and 6359 columns.
